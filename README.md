# light-scheduler
A scalable event scheduler based on transactional Kafka streams and interactive queries

There are so many schedulers implemented in Java as open source projects, and most of them are Java EE based and cannot scale. Also, most of them contain a task executor to execute services in the same thread synchronously. It further reduces the throughput as a single node can only handle a limited workload. 

The light-scheduler is not a task schedule but an event scheduler. The scheduler cluster is not responsible for executing the tasks but just send events to an output Kafka topic which can be partitioned with up to thousands. Each partition can be handled by a task executor that can handle thousands of tasks per second. The limitation is the network card throughput 10GB (over 1 million events assuming 1kb per event) most of the cases per node. 


### Use cases

Light-scheduler is time-based with both single trigger and repeating Cron like config. It can be used by a service to schedule a request that needs to be processed in the future. The service registers an event in the scheduler and suspends the processing of the current request. 

When the time arrives the requesting service is notified by the scheduler and former can resume processing of the suspended request.

Here are some of the use cases: 

* Delayed - A job to be executed 30 minutes from now
* Retry - Schedule an exponential backoff retry intervals of 1, 2, 4, 16, 256 and so on.
* Timeout - Schedule a timeout check event to be executed after 1 min
* Polling - Schedule a Cron job to be executed at some specified frequency
* Workflow - Distributed workflow with state suspensions and resumptions
* Batch jobs - This is the basic functionality of enterprise scheduler
* Execution Window - Event must be scheduled in the next valid window. For example, from 9 to 5. If retry falls out of execution window, it must be executed in the next execution window. 

### Requirement

* Master/Master cluster. Each node works independently on its own partition. This gives us the capability to scale linearly limited only by Kafka partitions. 
* Extremely fault tolerant. If a node is down, the partition will be picked up by another node in the same consumer group automatically.
* Uniform Partitioning. Round-robin distribution of events to all partitions. 
* Uniform Execution. All nodes share a similar load in quantity.
* Multi-tenancy. Each event belongs to one tenant, and each tenant can define the rule for event distribution. 
* Exact once delivery. All events are processed in a transactional context and guarantee to delivery exactly one. 



### Design

The events will be injected to a Kafka topic which is partitioned. Each event has a key to decide which partition to injected to. You need to pick the key from entity id or so that all event-related for one entity can be pushed to the same partition and handled in order if necessary. 

You can have many injection nodes as event producers, and usually, these are microservices instances. 

For every partition, we start a microservice instance to process the streams of the event and put these events into a 1-minute bucket based on the scheduled time. The events will be saved in a key/value store on each node with the time is the key and a list of the events as value. 

For the consumer node, it also constantly scan the key/value store per minute to check if there is any event that needs to be delivered. If there are send all the event schedule at that minute to the delivery topic. 

If delivery fails, the scanner will reschedule the delivery again in the next minute. It is configurable on how many minutes to scan in the past. 


##### Event  Injection and Event Execution

By using Kafka, we have a distinct separation of event injection and execution so that each side can be scaled independently given the use cases and workload. 

There are two interfaces for the event injection: Kafka producer and REST API and both of them must support transactions to ensure that no event is lost. 

For the event injection, the limitation is the throughput of Kafka producer and it is linearly scalable. Of cause, the limitation is the network throughput in the end. 

For the event execution, we are going to provide Kotlin based executors for most of the use cases with coroutine built-in. This is much more efficient than Java thread as it is lightweight and non-blocking. It would be very easy to support up to a million task executions in commodity hardware. 

Along with standard task executors, we can push the execution event to one or more topics that some microservices subscribed. In this case, the task is executed , but we need a way to track the status. We can also invoke an API to execute task synchronously from REST executor. 

##### Chaining of Event

In some of the use cases, several related jobs must be executed in sequence or a pre-defined order. It might be too much for the scheduler to handle this at the injection phase; however, it would be easy to create a microservices or just a customized executor to handle this kind of particular requirement. 

##### Logging, Tracing and Auditing

The entire inject/execute chain is transactional and the status must be updated once the job is executed successfully or failed to close the loop. We also need to provide a dashboard to give the user an interface to monitor and report the scheduler activities. 


##### File Watcher Injector

For most of the enterprise schedulers which are based on batch jobs, we need to support the smooth migration. That means we need to have a special injector that can monitor one or more specific directories in the filesystem and pick up a file that contains a list of tasks. We need to define a standard format for the file and provide examples for convertor implementation that can be easily injected with service.yml config. Eventually, the events will be injected to the Kafka input topic through Kafka producer or a REST API. This particular injector can be built as a light-4j microservice or a daemon process. 


### Build and Start

The scaffolded project contains a single module. A fat jar server.jar will be generated in target directory after running the build command below.

```
./mvnw clean install -Prelease
```

With the fatjar in the server/target directory, you can start the server with the following command.

```
java -jar server/target/server.jar
```

To speed up the test, you can avoid the fat jar generation and start the server from Maven.

```
./mvnw clean install exec:exec
```




### Test

Before runing the test, you need to start the confluent platform locally. You can use the docker-compose from the kafka-sidecar repository. 

```
cd ~/networknt/kafka-sidecar
docker-compose up -d
```

Create the following topics for the scheduler from the control center.

```
light-scheduler 16 partitions
controller-health-check 16 partitions
```

By default, the OAuth2 JWT security verification is disabled, so you can use Curl or Postman to test your service right after the server is started. For example, the petstore API has the following endpoint.

```
curl -k --location --request POST 'https://localhost:8443/schedulers' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "host": "networknt.com",
    "name": "market-192.168.1.1-health-check",
    "frequency": {
      "timeUnit": "MINUTES",
      "time": 2
    },
    "topic": "controller-health-check",
    "data": {
      "key1": "value1",
      "key2": "value2"
    }
}'
```

For your API, you need to change the path to match your specifications.
